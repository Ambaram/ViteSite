    <p>Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y—as in "a" then 11 characters then "y") in Web development means enabling as many people as 
      possible to use Web sites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way. For many people, technology makes things easier.</p>

            the dev build process that most of front-end developers use: the source code, which is not directly
            understandable by browsers,
            is compiled and bundled. The main reason for bundling is that browsers do not understand modules formats
            used in the source code (cf B.),
            so we have to concatenate everything into huge scripts. The pain point here is that, for any modification
            done in the source code,
            part or all of the application has to be rebuilt, which takes time.

            Vite is a development server based on ES modules and a production server based on the bundler Rollup (which
            itself relies on ES modules).
            Even though Vite has built-in support for Vue apps (this point is being discussed here), Vite is
            framework-agnostic and can support other
            frameworks with plugins. It currently has working plugins for React, Preact and Svelte. Also, VitePress, a
            static site generator based
            on Vue and Vite ("VuePress's brother") is currently under development.
            <!---
              -->In dev mode, Vite supports HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for the frameworks previously mentionned.

            Using tables for page layout adds additional verbosity to screen reader users. Whenever a screen reader encounters a table, 
            the user is informed that there is a table with "x" number of columns and rows, which distracts from the content. Also, 
            the content may be read in an order that does not match the visual order of the page. Do not create the layout of a website 
            using a table; instead, use CSS for presentation.When a data table is necessary (i.e. you have a set of data that is best 
            interpreted in a table format, such as a bank statement), use headers for rows and columns, which helps explain the 
            relationships of cells. Complex tables may have several cells within the table that have a unique relationship to each other, 
            and these should be identified by using the "scope" attribute in HTML. Table captions (HTML5) can be used to give additional 
            information to users about how best to read and understand the table relationships.

            ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a complex, powerful technical specification for adding accessibility information 
            to elements that are not natively accessible. You should always use native HTML elements when they are available. Remember, the 
            first rule of ARIA is “Don’t use ARIA.” Many functions that used to require ARIA attributes are now implemented in HTML5.

              Users with mobility disabilities, including repetitive stress injuries, may not be able to use a mouse or trackpad. 
              These people are able to access content through the use of a keyboard by pressing the "tab" or "arrow" keys, or through the 
              use of alternative input devices such as single-switch input or mouth stick. As a result, the tab order should match the 
              visual order, so keyboard-only users are able to logically navigate through site content.Long pages with lots of content 
              should be broken up with anchor links (jump lists), allowing keyboard-only users to skip to relevant portions of the page 
              without having to negotiate through other content. "Skip to main content" should be provided at the top of each page, so 
              keyboard-only users won't have to tab through the page navigation in order to get the main content.For pages with local menus 
              and multiple levels and sub-items, the menus should be configured so that all menu items can be accessed with the keyboard. 
              Do not use elements that only activate when a user hovers over items with a mouse, as keyboard-only or screen readers users 
              will not be able to activate them.
